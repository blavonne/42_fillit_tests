# 42_fillit_tests
Hi, darlings!<br>
There are 3 folders, which include figures.<br>
Maps1 folder contains only one figure in a map.<br>
Maps2 folder contains two figures in a map.<br>
Maps3 folder contains difficult tests, for example 26 ####.<br>
Test displays also time for maps3-tests.<br>
<b>You should put your binary fillit (named fillit) in root folder(tests) and run ./test.sh.</b><br>
Unfortunetly there is no key to interpretate the result.<br>
You should look for mistakes by yourself.<br>
Good luck!
